# Customer Segmentation using K-means clustering Algorithm

Market segmentation can help you to define and better understand your target audiences and ideal customers. If you're a marketer, this allows you to identify the right market for your products and then target your marketing more effectively.

Using Machine Learning algorithms makes it easy to segment your customers according to their behaviours. This can be done by just collecting basic data for example customer's annual income, their purchase history etc. Usually mall owners issue a card to customers which is used to track their purchase history.
